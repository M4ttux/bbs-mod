# BBS mod

BBS mod is a Minecraft mod for Fabric 1.20.4 and 1.20.1 (works on Forge as well) for creating animations within Minecraft. It has more features than that, but overall its main task is to facilitate making animated content within Minecraft. For more information, see BBS mod's [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/bbs-mod/) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bbs-mod) pages.

This repository is the source code of BBS mod. The `1.20.4` code is in the `master` branch, and `1.20.1` in `1.20.1` branch, which is usually just a merge of the `master` branch.

If you'd like to contribute to BBS mod code-wise, I'm not looking for contributions. **Please fork the repository, and make your own version**.

## Que voy a hacer en este FORK

- Implementar en el keyframe/tracker de "Damage" un boton para hacer "/kill" al Actor.

- Implementar un nuevo keyframe/tracker llamado "Shadow".

- Ver si es posible agregar al Model Block la posibilidad de equipar items al modelo.
